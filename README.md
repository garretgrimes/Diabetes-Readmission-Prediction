The healthcare landscape in the United States has seen significant changes over the years, driven by advancements in medical technology, evolving treatment protocols, and an aging population. One critical area of healthcare management is the care provided to diabetic patients during inpatient encounters. In this notebook, I delve into a comprehensive dataset that offers a glimpse into a decade of clinical care at 130 US hospitals and integrated delivery networks, spanning from 1999 to 2008. 

The dataset includes a wide array of attributes, such as patient demographics (including race, gender, and age), admission types, the duration of hospitalization, the medical specialty of admitting physicians, the number of lab tests conducted, A1c test results, diagnoses, the number of medications administered, and details about diabetic medications. Additionally, it provides insights into patients' healthcare utilization patterns, including the number of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency visits in the year preceding their hospitalization.

This data presents a unique opportunity to explore patterns, trends, and outcomes in diabetes care. This analysis aims to uncover valuable insights that can inform healthcare practitioners, policymakers, and researchers in their efforts to enhance the quality of diabetes care in the United States.

In the sections of this notebook, I will perform data exploration, preprocessing, analysis, and leveraging machine learning techniques to gain deeper insights into this critical aspect of healthcare.
